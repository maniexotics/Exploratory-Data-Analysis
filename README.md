# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
CASE SUMMARY: Analysis of the "cardiographic.csv" Dataset 
Detailed Findings:
Outliers: Columns such as Cholesterol, RestingBP, MaxHR, Oldpeak, DL (Decelerations Late), DS (Decelerations Short), and DP (Decelerations Prolonged) contain notable outliers.

Example: The Cholesterol column showed extreme values far beyond the typical range, which could indicate measurement errors or true extreme cases.

Missing Values:Several columns had varying levels of missing data.

Example: The Oldpeak column had a significant number of missing values, necessitating careful consideration for imputation or exclusion.

Zero Statistics:Certain columns, potentially DL, DS, and DP, had zero values for mean, median, and standard deviation, indicating all values in these columns might be zeros or have no variability.


DATA DESCRIPTION:
1.LB - Likely stands for "Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (FHR)" which represents the average fetal heart rate over a period.

2.AC - Could represent "Accelerations" in the FHR. Accelerations are usually a sign of fetal well-being.

3.FM - May indicate "Fetal Movements" detected by the monitor.

4.UC - Likely denotes "Uterine Contractions", which can impact the FHR pattern.

5.DL - Could stand for "Decelerations Late" with respect to uterine contractions, which can be a sign of fetal distress.

6.DS - May represent "Decelerations Short" or decelerations of brief duration.

7.DP - Could indicate "Decelerations Prolonged", or long-lasting decelerations.

8.ASTV - Might refer to "Percentage of Time with Abnormal Short Term Variability" in the FHR.

9.MSTV - Likely stands for "Mean Value of Short Term Variability" in the FHR.

10.ALTV - Could represent "Percentage of Time with Abnormal Long Term Variability" in the FHR.

11.MLTV - Might indicate "Mean Value of Long Term Variability" in the FHR.


Goals of Exploratory Data Analysis:
Understand Data Structure: Gain insights into the variables and their relationships within the dataset.

Identify Patterns and Trends: Discover patterns, anomalies, or trends that may not be obvious at first glance.

Detect Outliers and Anomalies: Identify potential errors or outliers that may require further investigation.

Formulate Hypotheses: Generate hypotheses for more focused statistical testing or modeling.

Techniques Used in Exploratory Data Analysis:
Summary Statistics: Calculate measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and percentiles to describe the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the data.

Data Visualization: Use plots like histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visually represent distributions, relationships, and trends in the data.

Data Cleaning: Address missing values, handle outliers, and transform variables as needed to prepare the data for further analysis.

Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) or t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to visualize high-dimensional data or reduce the number of variables.

Steps Involved in Exploratory Data Analysis:
Data Collection: Gather the dataset from relevant sources, ensuring it's comprehensive and accurately represents the phenomenon of interest.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing data, remove duplicates, and format data types appropriately.

Exploratory Visualization: Create plots and graphs to examine distributions, correlations, and outliers in the data.

Statistical Analysis: Compute summary statistics and perform initial hypothesis testing to understand the dataset's characteristics.

Interpretation and Reporting: Summarize findings, outline insights, and suggest next steps for more in-depth analysis or modeling.

Importance of Exploratory Data Analysis:
Data Quality Assurance: Helps ensure data quality by identifying issues like missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies early on.

Pattern Recognition: Reveals hidden patterns or relationships that can guide subsequent analysis or modeling efforts.

Hypothesis Generation: Provides a basis for formulating hypotheses and guiding more focused research questions.

Communication: Facilitates effective communication of insights and findings to stakeholders through visual and statistical summaries.
